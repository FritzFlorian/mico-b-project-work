# mico-b-project-work

Simple project done in an introductory course for microcontroller programming. Two NanoESP
microcontrollers communicate over MQTT, with one having sensors and the other actuators.
The MQTT server handles topics that sensor values are published to and the actuators,
as well as an IoT software visualize them.

The [project report](/report.pdf) contains further details.
